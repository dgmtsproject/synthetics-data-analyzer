# TWA Research Dashboard

Enhanced Synthetic US Wellness & Aging Dataset Generation with TWA Impact Modeling

## Overview

This React application implements a comprehensive research framework for generating synthetic datasets focused on wellness and aging outcomes. Based on the latest longevity research, it creates scientifically rigorous synthetic data that links Tiny Wellness Activities (TWA) to validated wellness and aging outcomes.

## Features

### ðŸ”¬ Research-Grounded Data Generation
- **14 validated biomarkers** of aging based on expert consensus
- **Blue Zone lifestyle patterns** integration
- **Evidence-based behavior correlations** from peer-reviewed studies
- **Longitudinal aging trajectories** with seasonal variations
- **Research-validated effect sizes** for all outcomes

### ðŸ“Š Interactive Dashboard
- **Dataset Overview**: Demographic distributions, health outcomes trends
- **TWA Behavior Analysis**: Do More, Do Less, and Connection & Purpose activities
- **Wellness Outcomes Analysis**: Biomarkers, functional measures, cognitive assessments
- **Research Validation**: Benchmark validation against published studies
- **Export Functionality**: JSON, CSV, and Excel export options

### ðŸŽ¯ TWA Framework

#### Do More Activities (Protective)
- **Motion**: Days/week vigorous activity (0-7)
- **Sleep**: Hours/night + sleep quality (1-10)
- **Hydration**: Cups/day (4-12)
- **Diet Quality**: Mediterranean adherence (0-100)
- **Meditation/Destress**: Minutes/week (0-300)

#### Do Less Activities (Risk)
- **Smoking**: Never/Former/Current status
- **Excessive Alcohol**: Drinks/week (>14 risk threshold)
- **Added Sugars**: Grams/day (>50g risk)
- **Excess Sodium**: Grams/day (>6g risk)
- **Ultra-processed Foods**: Servings/week (>10 risk)

#### Connection & Purpose
- **Social Networks**: Close relationships count (0-10)
- **Nature Connection**: Minutes/week in greenspace
- **Cultural Engagement**: Hours/week music/art
- **Purpose/Meaning**: Life purpose scale (1-10)

## Scientific Foundation

### Research Evidence Integration
- **Methylation-supportive diet/lifestyle**: 4.6-year biological age reduction
- **Mediterranean diet + exercise**: 0.66-year GrimAge reduction
- **Social connection impact**: 50% greater longevity chance
- **Purpose in life**: 40% mortality risk reduction (HR=0.60)

### Biomarkers of Aging
- **Physiological**: IGF-1, GDF-15, CRP, IL-6
- **Functional**: Muscle mass/strength, grip strength, gait speed, balance
- **Cognitive**: Cognitive health assessments
- **Epigenetic**: DNA methylation clocks (Horvath, GrimAge, PhenoAge)

- Occupation and other demographic factors

### TWA Behaviors (14 variables)
- **Do More**: Motion, sleep, hydration, diet, meditation
- **Do Less**: Smoking, alcohol, sugar, sodium, processed foods
- **Connection & Purpose**: Social, nature, cultural, purpose

### Wellness Outcomes (20+ variables)
- **Core Health**: Biological age, mortality risk, lifespan
- **Biomarkers**: CRP, IL-6, IGF-1, GDF-15, cortisol
- **Functional**: Grip strength, gait speed, balance, frailty
- **Cognitive**: Composite score, processing speed
- **Psychosocial**: Life satisfaction, stress, depression risk

### Research Validation (8 variables)
- Exercise guidelines compliance
- Sleep guidelines compliance
- High diet quality indicators
- Regular meditation practice
- Strong social support
- High purpose scores
- Healthy aging profile
- Blue Zone similarity score

## Research Applications

1. **TWA Intervention Modeling**: Predict biological age changes from lifestyle modifications
2. **Personalized Longevity Planning**: Individual risk/benefit analysis for behavior changes
3. **Population Health Insights**: Demographic patterns in healthy aging trajectories
4. **Blue Zone Replication**: Test which combinations of factors drive longevity
5. **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify novel aging biomarkers from behavior patterns

## Validation Benchmarks
